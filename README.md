# Gemini PDF Assistant - Streamlit App

This is a Streamlit-based intelligent assistant that allows you to upload PDF documents and interact with them using **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash**. It provides a conversational interface to ask questions about the content, get references, generate detailed notes, take tests, and jot down personal ideas in a notepad. Built with a future scope for deployment as a web and mobile application.
